good practice
    don't run jobs on login/head nodes
    don't run too many jobs (25/50 limit)
    don't use all the disk space
    use all the cores on the node, use parallel to force this
    make jobs that last at least a few minutes



## Best Practices

Again, working on a cluster is working in a big sandbox, with people of all ages and skills. So it is
important to work carefully and be considerate. Please visit our list of Common Pitfalls and 
Fair Use/Responsibilities pages so that you'll be a good member of the community...

## Distributed System Definitions and stacks:
  (Note that many definitions exist for these terms)

 * Distributed application: an application that can be executed on a distributed system platform (e.g., mpiBLAST)
 * Distributed system platform: software layers that facilitates coordination and management of a distributed system (e.g., queue-based system, and MapReduce)
 * Distributed system:
   * High Performance Computing (HPC): large assemble of physical machines and a homogeneous operating system (e.g., your institutions' HPC, XSEDE's HPC)
   * Cloud Computing: virtual machines, distributed platforms and/or applications offered as a service (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Computing)

 * Virtual machine (VM): software computer that like a physical computer can run an operating system and applications
 * Operating system (OS): the basic software layer that allows execution and management of applications
 * Physical machine: the hardware (processors, memory, disk and network)
