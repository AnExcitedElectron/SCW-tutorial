## Using & installing software

On most cluster systems, all the software installed is not immediately available for use;
instead, it is loaded into your environment incrementally using amodule system. 

The module command controls this. 
You can get a list of available software with the `module avail` command. This should return a long list of available software.

Lets load Python version 3.5.1 as a module:

If we first try to run python3 it won't work

```$ python3
-bash: python3: command not found```

But if we now load the module and try again it should:

```$ module load python/3.5.1
$ python3
Python 3.5.1 (default, Jun 22 2016, 13:43:55) 
[GCC Intel(R) C++ gcc 4.4.7 mode] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

```

### Installing Python modules

Python is a popular language for researchers to use and has modules (aka libraries) that do all kinds of useful things, but sometimes the module you need won't be installed. Many modules can be installed using the pip (or pip3 with python3) command. Before we can install modules we need to load the http-proxy module which allows the login node access to the internet via another computer (the proxy). 

```module load http-proxy
```

We also don't have permissions to install pip modules for the whole system, so we need to give pip the `--user` argument which tells us to install in our home directory. Note that this install will only be for the HPC Wales system you're logged into, so if you install a module in Cardiff it won't be available on the Swansea systems but will work on other Cardiff systems.

``pip3 install --user <modulename>```

Lets install the sklean module, this is a module which is useful for machine learning tasks. 
```pip3 install --user sklearn
Collecting sklearn

Collecting scikit-learn (from sklearn)

You are using pip version 8.1.2, however version 9.0.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
```


*For Perl & Python modules or R packages*, we encourage you to set up directories in your
home and/or lab folders for installing your own copies locally. 

*If software you need is not installed*, we encourage you to do local installs in your home
or lab folder for bleeding-edge releases, software you are testing, or software used
only by your lab. For programs that are commonly used by your domain, field, 
or department, please submit a 
[software install request](email support@hpcwales.co.uk).
Note that due to demand and the complex nature of software installs, it may take a while for us to complete these requests.
