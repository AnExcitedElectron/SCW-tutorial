### Objectives
* Why use a cluster?
* Understand how a cluster is organized
* Understand what a filesystem is and which are appropriate to use
* Know how to interact with the scheduler
* Be comfortable creating a batch script and submitting one
* Know which command get info about and control jobs

### Cluster basics

Clusters, otherwise know as high-performance computing (HPC) or high-throughput computing systems, belong to a class of computing environments known as Advanced CyberInfrastructure (ACI). ACI resources also include other high-end compute systems such as distributed databases, large-scale fileystems, and software-defined networks. These tools are becoming the *de facto* standard tools in most research disciplines today.

### What are some of reasons to access a remote computer system?

 * Your computer does not have enough resources to run the desired analysis (memory, processors, disk space, network bandwidth).
 * You want to produce results faster than your computer can.
 * You cannot install software in your computer (application does not have support for your operating system, conflicts with other existing applications)

### Advantages of using HPC/HTC vs. Cloud systems

list them here...

### Filesystems

### Working with the scheduler
* what it does
* how to interact with it
    srun, sbatch, squeue, scancel, and sacct
* what you need to know to get your work done
    resource requests
    partitions
    making & submitting script files


### Running & submitting jobs



### Distributed System Definitions and stacks:
  (Note that many definitions exist for these terms)

 * Distributed application: an application that can be executed on a distributed system platform (e.g., mpiBLAST)
 * Distributed system platform: software layers that facilitates coordination and management of a distributed system (e.g., queue-based system, and MapReduce)
 * Distributed system:
   * High Performance Computing (HPC): large assemble of physical machines and a homogeneous operating system (e.g., your institutions' HPC, XSEDE's HPC)
   * Cloud Computing: virtual machines, distributed platforms and/or applications offered as a service (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Computing)

 * Virtual machine (VM): software computer that like a physical computer can run an operating system and applications
 * Operating system (OS): the basic software layer that allows execution and management of applications
 * Physical machine: the hardware (processors, memory, disk and network)

### HPC vs. Cloud:

| HPC | Cloud |
|:----|:------|
| User account on the system | root account on the system |
| Limited control of the system | Full control of the system |
| Central shared file system | Local file system |
| Jobs submitted into a queue | Jobs executed on each resource |
| Account-based isolation | OS-based isolation |
| Batch-oriented execution of applications | support for batch or interactive applications |
| Request for resource and time allocation | Pay-per-use |
| etc. | etc.|
