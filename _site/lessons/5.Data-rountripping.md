# Moving data to and from your remote server

Without a doubt, moving data around can be tedious. When working with remote systems, it 
becomes even harder, as you'll need to specify the exact path to files and/or directories
you wish to transfer, in addition to the host you wish to access. We'll address those concerns here.

### Objectives
* Know what tools to use to download data from the interweb
* Successfully use FileZilla (GUI) to copy data to/from your remote account
* Successfully use `scp` to copy data to/from your remote account

## Moving data is simple
(but not always easy!)


You've already been working in your cluster account, moving data from external servers
into your directories as well as moving data around within your account.

Remember, when you downloaded the *E. coli* reference genome 

```bash
$ wget ftp://bacteria.ensemble....
```

In this case, you are using a command line tool, `wget`, to download content from a webserver.  This command supports downloading files from FTP and HTTP(s).  The tool `wget` also supports recursive download (with the parameter `-r`), allowing you to download content from a directory or folder.  For your information, there are other command line tools that can also be used to download data (e.g., `curl`), but `wget` should serve you well for this lesson and bioinformatic analysis.

In addition to these, both `scp` and `rsync` are indespensible command-line tools for transferring data. `scp` is the easiest of the two to use. `rsync` is only slightly harder, but is much more powerful: it can resume interrupted transfers, and is smart enough to transfer only the parts of files that have changed, not the entire

### Moving files between your laptop and your cluster account

#### Using the FileZilla GUI (all platforms)

0. Ensure that you have followed [our configuration instructions on the RC webiste](https://rc.fas.harvard.edu/resources/documentation/transferring-data/sftp-file-transfer/).
1. Open Filezilla
2. Start your connection
3. Move to the appropriate directory in your remote connection window (the cluster)
4. Drag and drop the file or directory from one location to the other.

So, that was the easy way. But you may not always be able to use a GUI. Command-line tools
to the rescue. Below, we'll use `scp` to transfer files to and from the cluster. These directions are platform specific so please follow the instructions for your system.

###Uploading Data to your account

#### PC

Using PC, we recommend you use the `PSCP` program. This program is from the same suite of tools as the putty program we have been using to connect. 

1. If you haven't done so, download pscp from [http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/pscp.exe](http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/pscp.exe)
2. Make sure the `PSCP` program is somewhere you know on your computer. In this case, your Downloads folder is appropriate. 
3. Open the windows [PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell); go to your start menu/search enter the term **'cmd'**; you will be able to start the shell (the shell should start from C:\Users\your-pc-username>). 
4.Change to the download directory
```
> cd Downloads
```
5. locate a file on your computer that you wish to upload (be sure you know the path). Then upload it to your cluster account. **NOTE!** You will need to know your cluster login account username and home directory path, and have your 2FA handy. You will be prompted to enter a password, and then your upload will begin. **(make sure you use substitute 'your-pc-username' for your actual pc username)**

```
C:\User\your-pc-username\Downloads> pscp.exe local_file.txt rcusername@login.rc.fas.harvard.edu:/path/to/homdir/
```

#### Mac/Linux

1. Open the terminal and use the `scp` command to upload a file (e.g. local_file.txt) to the dcuser home directory:

```bash
$  scp local_file.txt rcusername@login.rc.fas.harvard.edu:/path/to/homdir/
```
###Downloading data from your cluster account

Let's download a zipped file from our working directory.  You should have a fastqc report in `~/dc_workshop/results/fastqc_untrimmed_reads/SRR097977_fastqc.zip`

**Tip:** If you are looking for another (or any really) zip file in your home directory to use instead try
   ```bash
$ find ~ -name *.zip
```

#### PC

1. Follow the instructions in the Upload section to download (if needed) and access the `PSCP` program (steps 1-3)
2. Download the zipped fastqc report using the following command **(make sure you use substitute 'your-pc-username' for your actual pc username and rcusername@login.rc.fas.harvard.edu with your remote login credentials and actual home directory path)**

```
C:\User\your-pc-username\Downloads> pscp.exe rcusername@login.rc.fas.harvard.edu:/path/to/homdir/dc_workshop/results/fastqc_untrimmed_reads/SRR097977_fastqc.zip C:\User\your-pc-username\Downloads
```

#### Mac/Linux

1. Download the fastqc report in ~/dc_workshop/results/fastqc_untrimmed_reads/SRR097977_fastqc.zip to your home ~/Dowload directory using the following command **(make sure you use substitute rcusername@login.rc.fas.harvard.edu:/path/to/homedir with your remote login credentials and actual home directory path)**:

```bash
$ scp rcusername@login.rc.fas.harvard.edu:/path/to/homdir/dc_workshop/results/fastqc_untrimmed_reads/SRR097977_fastqc.zip ~/Downloads
```
