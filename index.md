# Introduction to Super Computing Wales

This lesson introduces using the Super Computing Wales HPC system. 

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Some basic experience of the Unix command line is expected. The material covered in the Software Carpentry Introduction to Unix Shell (http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) is more than enough to cover this.

This lesson has been (heavily) adapted from the Data Carpentry Cloud Genomics lesson and in particular the Harvard University Faculty of Arts & Sciences Research Computing HPC version of it (https://github.com/fasrc/DataC-HPC-genomics).
